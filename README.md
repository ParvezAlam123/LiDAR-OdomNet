LiDAR odometry is an important problem for au-
tonomous vehicles, robotics, drone, etc. This paper proposes
a data-driven deep learning-based LiDAR odometry network
LiDAR-OdomNet (LiDAR Odometry Network). The network has
been trained on the KITTI odometry benchmark. It predicts
translation parameters of the pose matrix with 0.0919 RMSE
value which is the minimum error obtained as compared to
state-of-the-art methods. An ablation study has been done using
experiments for the importance of the proposed method. We
have analyzed every parameter of the pose matrix and plotted
the results.
