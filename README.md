LiDAR odometry is an important problem for au-
tonomous vehicles, robotics, drone, etc. In this paper, we have
proposed a data-driven deep learning-based LiDAR odometry
network LiDAR-OdomNet (LiDAR Odometry Network). The net-
work has been trained on the KITTI odometry benchmark. It is
predicting translation parameters of the pose matrix with 0.0919
RMSE value which is the minimum error obtained as compared
to state-of-the-art methods. We have analyzed every parameter
of the pose matrix and plotted the results.
